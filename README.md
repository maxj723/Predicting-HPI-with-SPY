# Predicting-HPI-with-SPY

We did a time series analysis to determine if there was a relationship between The U.S. Stock Market and U.S. Home Prices.   
   
The R markdown file shows the code used for the report. It was knitted to produce Analysis_Report.pdf.   
   
The ipynb file is used to clean the spy data into a more usable format.   
   
playground.R shows most of the code (unorganized) used in the process of coming to the results in Analysis_Report.Rmd.
